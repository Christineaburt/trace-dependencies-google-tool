This Google Apps Script tool traces numerical data points (like `$56`) from a Google Doc table and matches them to their original source cells in a connected Google Sheet. It outputs cell location data for the relevant data in the doc, allowing reviewers to verify the origin of each data point at a glance.

ðŸ§ª Beta Notice:
This tool is currently in beta. The final version will be a cloud-initiated application using the Google Cloud SDK and APIs to programmatically add comments inside the Google Doc.
